    "Causal effect and mediation analysis can also be used for more aggregate measures. The Average Causal Effect (ACE) quantifies how strong the effect of a single variable on the whole system is and the Average Causal Susceptibility (ACS) quantifies how strong a single variable is effected by perturbations entering elsewhere in the system. Last, the Average Mediated Causal Effect (AMCE) quantifies how much a single variable mediates causal effects between any two other processes. In Runge et al, Nature Communications (2015), these measures are compared with conventional complex network measures to show that causal effect measures are better interpretable alternatives. For example, *betweenness centrality* gives the average number of shortest paths going through a particular node. However, causal effects do not necessarily take shortest paths and betweenness also does not properly take into account the causal effect weights."

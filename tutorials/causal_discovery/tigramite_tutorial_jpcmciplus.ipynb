    "This tutorial explains the Joint-PCMCI+ (J-PCMCI+) algorithm, which is implemented as the function ```J_PCMCI.run_jpcmciplus```. In contrast to the PCMCI and PCMCIplus algorithms, J-PCMCI+ is specifically designed to handle time series data from different datasets that include observations of the same variables  but that were collected in different contexts. The contexts are assumed to be represented by specific variables that are either constant across time or over the given datasets.\n",
